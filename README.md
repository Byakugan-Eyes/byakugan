A refreshing take on [Shinigami Eyes](https://github.com/shinigami-eyes/shinigami-eyes)

Goals are:
- to expand issues that a link can be flagged for, not just for pro-trans and anti-trans links
- make the codebase modular to allow for easy expansion for formatting on websites
- make the process of adding websites to the central list more transparent and community driven
- incorporate some of the good ideas mentioned in the [Community Eyes Readme](https://github.com/SneakyBastardSword/community-eyes/blob/master/README.md) which hasn't been developed on
